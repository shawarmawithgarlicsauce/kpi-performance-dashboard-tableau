An Interactive KPI Dashboard created on Tableau. 

Hello! I created this dashboard to showcase my skills in creating a visually appealing dashboard on Tableau. 

The dashboard aims to solve a few common questions businesses often struggle to answer:
- How are our sales and profits performing over time?
- Which products or regions are driving or hurting performance?
- Are discounts affecting profitability?

This dashboard solves that problem by consolidating key performance indicators (KPIs) into one visual summary that helps managers and analysts:
- Monitor overall performance (Sales, Profit, Discount).
- Identify trends over months and years.
- Compare performance across products and states.
- Detect anomalies or underperforming areas that need attention.
